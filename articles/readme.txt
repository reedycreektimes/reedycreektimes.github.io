 Top 5 Best 
Things of 6th Grade 
By Owen 
This year was definitely a weird one, but I am here today, not to talk about Covid, and not to talk about something bad. I am instead here to talk about the top 5 best things that happened in sixth grade. 
1. In October, our fearless leader, Dr.Cooper moved to NC 
Virtual Schools. To replace him, Mr. Evans hired Mr. Warren, 
who has done a great job since day one. He created a Google 
Classroom where we could socialize, he is always happy to 
talk to you, he knows lots of people’s names, and takes every 
chance he can to say “Hi.” 
2. The 6th grade Social Time may only have 
lasted for a short period of time, but I feel it is 
worth mentioning. During this social time 
students were allowed to play online games 
such as Jeopardy, Kahoot, Booklet, Among Us, 
and many more. This was great for sixth 
graders because it allowed us to do something 
we haven't done in a long time: Interact with 
each other. 
3. The PBIS Raffle is also definitely something to 
note. The raffle was created to encourage students to go 
to their Google Meets and complete their assignments 
on time. If they did this they would get the chance to win 
a gift card to one of the many fast food restaurants, or win some Reedy Creek spirit wear. Overall though this raffle was a lot of fun, especially for the people who won.
4. Going back to school was also something that 
many 6th graders enjoyed immensely. This 
allowed us to experience what middle school was 
actually like, something some thought they 
wouldn’t experience until at least 7th grade. It is 
true, not everyone went back, but at least they 
had the choice. 
5. The sport practices were also a fun addition to 
the year. While it is a rule that 6th graders can’t 
usually join Reedy Creek sports teams, this year 
they were allowed to do sport practices. These 
practices lasted for one week, but were later 
extended to three weeks. This allowed 6th graders 
to have an idea of what sports could be like without 
making a long term commitment. 
To conclude, 6th grade 2020-2021 could have been better, but we did have some good moments. Now we can only wait till next year where our future lies ahead!
